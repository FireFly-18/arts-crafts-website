        <h4>Hello!</h4>
        <p>Welcome to The Artist Craft Corner, I'm the creator, here to tell you more about this page. <br>
        The Artist Craft Corner is an online shop where you can purchase diffrent arts and crafts supplies for your projects, and check our gallery for crafts tutorials.<br><br>
        As an artist, I know how hard it is the find good paints and brushes that don't cost way more than they should. So here, we recommend more affordable choices for supplies. <br><br>
        This website was made to help other artist find in budget products. I do arts and crafts a lot, which requires diffrent materials and tools, and i can understand that some products just cant be found, like certain felt or glue, and substitutes fail to work, so i made sure to include many diffrent types of materials. <br><br>
        I do both digital and traditonal art, so that'll be showcased in the image gallery.<br><br>
        Thanks for reading! </p>
